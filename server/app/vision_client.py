"""Thin async client for the vision model, over the OpenAI chat-completions API.

That API is what nearly every model server speaks — Ollama (the default, at /v1),
llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio — and hosted services too. So one client covers them all,
and "local Ollama" is nothing but the default base URL.
